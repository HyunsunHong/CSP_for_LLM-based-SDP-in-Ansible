The code provided appears to be Ansible scripts aimed at deploying AEM packages and ensuring restricted access to the "su" command. Let's review each script against the given code smells:

### Q1:
#### Code Smells Detected:
- HP1: Unnecessary use of `set_fact` for variable "_content_package_maven_plugin_version@0".

#### Conclusion:
- Defective: The code contains the code smell of type HP1, which makes it defective.

### Q2:
#### Code Smells Detected:
- No code smells detected since it is a fixed version of the original script.

#### Conclusion:
- Not Defective: The fixed code does not contain any code smells.

### Q (Access to 'su' command restriction):
#### No code smells detected in this script.

#### Conclusion:
- Not Defective: The script does not contain any code smells.

Thus, the Q1 script is defective due to the HP1 code smell, whereas the Q2 and Q scripts are not defective. If you have any more scripts to review or need further assistance, feel free to provide them.

This code snippet contains multiple code smells:

1. UR1: The variable "rgwstatus" is used to check if the RGW service is running, but it is not subsequently utilized in any conditional statement. This indicates a potential impure initialiser code smell.

2. UO2: The playbook includes commented-out tasks (apt_repository) that are not used during execution. These unused definitions represent a manifest definition code smell.

3. "set_fact" and "include_vars" modules are not used in this example, so there are no instances of HP1 or HP2 code smells.

Overall, it appears that the code contains code smells of UR1 and UO2 types, indicating potential defects in the script.

 : start===================================================
This code contains a code smell of type HP2, as "include_vars" is unnecessarily used when it will be executed unconditionally. Therefore, the code is defective.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code contains multiple code smells:

1. **UR1**: The `zabbix_short_version` variable is defined with the `set_fact` task without considering any previous definition. This violates the UR1 code smell as the variable value may have changed unintentionally.

2. **UO1**: The tasks to include OS-specific variables using `include_vars` are unconditionally executed without considering the possibility of a previous definition. This violates the UO1 code smell as the new definitions may override the previous ones without proper consideration.

3. **HP2**: The `include` tasks for different OS families are unconditionally executed based on the `ansible_os_family` variable without taking any condition into account. This violates the HP2 code smell as the `include_vars` tasks are unnecessarily used when they will be executed unconditionally.

4. **UO2**: The `agent_listenip` and `agent_ip` variables are defined with the `set_fact` task, but the `agent_ip` definition is not used after being defined, violating the UO2 code smell as the definition is unused.

Therefore, this code is defective and contains code smells that need to be addressed for better code quality.

 : start===================================================
This code contains a code smell of type UO1. In the first two set_fact tasks, the variable "es_script_dir" is redefined without taking the previous definition into account, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. Therefore, the code is defective.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code contains the following code smells:

1. UR1: Due to an impure initialiser, the variable value may have changed.
2. UR2: The upstream variable has been redefined, so the variable value may have changed.
3. UO1: A new definition overrides a previous definition at a higher precedence without taking the previous definition into account.
4. UO2: A variable definition is manifested while a previous definition already exists, so the definition is unused.

For example:
- The use of `set_fact` for the variable "force_install" in the first two tasks shows inconsistency and potential value changes.
- In the "Debian - Ensure elasticsearch is installed" task, the variable "force_install" is set based on a condition, which may result in the value being different than initially set in the "set_fact" tasks.

Therefore, this code is considered defective due to the identified code smells.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code contains a code smell of type UR1, because the variable "es_script_dir" is assigned different values in multiple places without considering the previous definition. Therefore, the code is defective.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This Ansible script contains the following code smells:

1. UR1: A new definition overrides a previous definition at a higher precedence without taking the previous definition into account.
2. UO1: The variable "es_plugins_install" may be unconditionally overridden in the second "set_fact" task without considering the previous definition.
3. HP1: "set_fact" is unnecessarily used to set the variable "list_command" before invoking the shell module where the condition is based on the "es_version".
4. UR2: The variable "plugin_installed" is redefined in the last task, potentially resulting in a change in its value.
5. UO2: The variable "plugin_installed" is defined in the last task but not used afterwards, indicating that the definition may be unused.

Therefore, the given Ansible script is defective due to the identified code smells.

This code does not contain any of the mentioned code smells, so it is not defective.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code snippet contains a code smell of type UO2. This is because the variable "openvpn_easyrsa_check" is defined twice in the script, but the first definition is never used or referred to again. Therefore, the code is defective.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code contains multiple code smells:
1. UO1: Potential unintended unconditional override of variable "zabbix_agent_tlspskfile" at tasks "AutoPSK | Set default path variables for Linux" and "AutoPSK | Set default path variables for Windows".
2. UO2: Variable "zabbix_agent_tlspskfile" is defined and unused at task "AutoPSK | Check for existing TLS PSK file".
3. HP1: "set_fact" is used unnecessarily at task "AutoPSK | Save existing TLS PSK secret", as the expression and task conditions already took higher precedence.
4. UR2: The upstream variable "zabbix_agent_tlspsk_read" is redefined without considering the previous definition at task "AutoPSK | Save existing TLS PSK secret".
5. UR2: The upstream variable "zabbix_agent_tlspskidentity" is redefined without considering the previous definition at task "AutoPSK | Use existing TLS PSK identity".

Therefore, this code is defective due to the presence of multiple code smells.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code contains a few code smells:
1. UR1: The variable "zabbix_agent_distribution_major_version" may have changed due to conflicting set_fact tasks that set it to different values depending on certain conditions. This might lead to unexpected behavior in the script.
2. UO1: The "zabbix_agent_distribution_major_version" is defined multiple times with different values based on conditions, potentially overriding each other and causing unintended consequences.

Therefore, the code is defective.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
The provided Ansible script contains several instances of code smells based on the defined categories:

1. UR1: There are no instances of variables being redefined with impure initializers.
2. UR2: The script does not contain any examples of upstream variables being redefined.
3. UO1: The script contains an example of unintentionally overriding a previous definition at a higher precedence without considering the previous definition:
   - In the code block setting the "arwp_plugin_is_installed" variable, there is a potential unintended unconditional override.
4. UO2: There are no instances where variables are defined but not used.
5. HP1: There are no instances of unnecessary use of "set_fact" tasks when higher precedence is already taken into account in the provided script.
6. HP2: The script includes the use of "include_vars" tasks that are executed unconditionally, which is considered as a code smell:
   - The script should consider conditional execution or alternative approaches for including variables to avoid unnecessary inclusion.

Therefore, the script contains code smells of type UO1 and HP2, which should be addressed to improve the script's quality and maintainability.

 : start===================================================
This code contains a few code smells:

1. UR1: Due to an impure initializer, the variable value may have changed. In the tasks named "set fact es_same_keystore" and "set fact es_same_keystore if stores match," the variable "es_same_keystore" is being set based on conditions, potentially changing its initial value. This is a code smell of type UR1.

2. UO1: A new definition overrides a previous definition at a higher precedence without taking the previous definition into account. In multiple tasks like "Upload SSL/TLS keystore," "Upload SSL/TLS truststore," "Upload SSL/TLS key and certificate," and others, certain variables like "copy_keystore," "copy_truststore," and "copy_certificates" are getting redefined without considering the implications of a previous definition. This is a code smell of type UO1.

3. HP1: "set_fact" is unnecessarily used when both the expression and all task conditions already took higher precedence. In the task named "Set keystore password," the use of "set_fact" for the variable "es_same_keystore" is unnecessary, as it is mentioned in another higher precedence conditional check. This is a code smell of type HP1.

Due to these code smells, the code may be considered defective and can be improved by addressing these issues.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code snippet contains a code smell of type HP2. The "include_vars" task for "elasticsearch-security-file.yml" will be executed unconditionally, as there is no condition specified. This can be considered unnecessary if the file needs to be included regardless of any condition. Hence, the code is defective due to the HP2 code smell.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code seems to contain several code smells that could be considered defective:

1. UR1: Potential change of variable "java_state".
2. UO1: Possible unintended unconditional override of variable "java_state".
3. UO2: Definition of "update_java" is unused.
4. HP1: "set_fact" is likely not needed for setting "java_state" as it's already conditionally handled in the tasks.
5. HP2: "apt" and "yum" tasks are unconditionally executed based on the OS family, which might not be necessary.

Therefore, the code could be improved to eliminate these code smells and make it more efficient and maintainable.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code snippet contains a code smell of type UO2. The variable "list_command" is a new definition that is manifested while a previous definition already exists with an empty value. Since the previous definition is not taken into account when the new definition is set, this is considered a code smell. Therefore, this part of the code is defective.

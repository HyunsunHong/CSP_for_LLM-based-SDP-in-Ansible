The provided Ansible script contains a code smell of type HP1. The unnecessary use of "set_fact" for the variable "_content_package_maven_plugin_version" indicates a code defect. It is recommended to refactor the code and remove this unnecessary usage of "set_fact".

On the other hand, the second Ansible script does not contain any code smells after the necessary corrections were made based on the previous analysis.

The provided Ansible script does not contain any code smells from the given categories. Therefore, the script is not defective.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code contains a code smell of type HP2, due to the unnecessary use of "include_vars" in the script. Since "include_vars" will be executed unconditionally, it violates the code smell guideline. Therefore, the code is defective.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code contains multiple code smells:

1. UO2: There is a redundant definition of a variable called "agent_ip" in the "Get IP of agent_listeninterface when no agent_listenip specified" task. This definition is unused and unnecessary.
2. UR1: The variable "agent_listenip" is set to a default value in multiple tasks, which may result in unintended changes due to impure initialization.
3. HP1: The "include_vars" task for OS-specific variables is used unconditionally, regardless of any conditions, which could be simplified since it will always be executed.
4. UR2: The variable "zabbix_short_version" is redefined multiple times in different tasks, which may lead to unintended changes.
5. UO1: The task "Install the correct repository" is defined multiple times for different OS families without taking the previous definitions into account, potentially leading to an unintentional override of the variable.
6. HP2: The task for "Set short version name" should not be included if there are no specific conditions to execute it, as it is an unconditional inclusion.

Therefore, this code is defective and contains multiple code smells that need to be addressed for better maintainability and clarity.

This code does not contain any of the mentioned code smells (UR1, UR2, UO1, UO2, HP1, HP2). Therefore, the code is not defective.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code contains a code smell of type UO1. An impure initialiser is present where the variable "es_script_dir" is being defined twice without considering the previous definition. This can lead to unexpected behavior as the variable value may have changed. Therefore, the code is defective.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code contains a code smell of type UO1, where a new definition overrides a previous definition at a higher precedence without considering the previous definition. Specifically, the "force_install" variable is defined twice without taking the previous definition into account. Therefore, this code is defective.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code contains a few code smells:
1. UR2: The variable "es_script_dir" is redefined multiple times, which may lead to unintended changes in its value.
2. UO2: The definition of "es_script_dir" at the second occurrence is unused, as it will never be executed due to the condition in the task.

Therefore, the code is defective.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code snippet contains the following code smells:

1. UR2: There is a redefinition of the variable "plugin_installed" in the playbook without considering the upstream variables, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

Therefore, this code snippet is considered defective due to the UR2 code smell.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code contains the following code smells:

1. UR1: The variable "kubeadmin_init" may have changed due to impure initialization in the "Initialize Kubernetes master with kubeadm init." task.
2. HP2: "include_tasks" is unnecessarily used in the task "[executing task lists for freckle folder]" when it will be executed unconditionally.

Therefore, the code is defective and needs to be addressed to remove these code smells.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
The provided code snippet contains no code smells from the listed categories UR1, UR2, UO1, UO2, HP1, and HP2. Therefore, the code is not defective.

 : start===================================================
This code contains a code smell of type HP2, because "include_vars" is unnecessarily used when it will be executed unconditionally. Therefore, the code is defective.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code contains a code smell of type UR1, as the variable "zabbix_agent_tlspsk_read" might have an impure initialiser due to the usage of "| b64decode | trim". Therefore, the code is defective.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code snippet does not contain any of the mentioned code smells, so it is not defective.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This Ansible script contains multiple code smells:

1. **UR1:** The code smell UR1 is present in the task "Set default ip address for zabbix_agent_ip" where the variable is set without considering if it's already defined. This can lead to unintended changes in the variable value.

2. **UO1:** The code smell UO1 is present in the task "Windows | Set variables specific to Zabbix 4.0" where the same variable "zabbix_win_exe_path" is defined again without taking the previous definition into account. This can lead to unintentional variable overrides.

3. **HP1:** The code smell HP1 is present in the tasks "Windows | Checking Update (Set default)" and "Windows | Checking Update" where "set_fact" is used unnecessarily when task conditions could have controlled the flow of the tasks.

4. **HP2:** The code smell HP2 is present in the task "Windows | Set default ip address for zabbix_agent_ip" where "include_vars" is not used but should have been, as it will be executed unconditionally.

Therefore, based on the identified code smells, this Ansible script is considered defective and needs to be refactored to address these issues.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code contains the following code smells:
1. UR1: There is an impure initialiser in the "set fact es_same_keystore" task. The variable value may have changed without considering the previous value.
2. UO1: The "es_same_keystore" variable is set twice with different conditions without considering the previous definition.

Therefore, the code is defective.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code contains a code smell of type HP2 because the "include_vars" task is executed unconditionally. Therefore, the code is defective.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code does not contain any of the specified code smells (UR1, UR2, UO1, UO2, HP1, HP2), meaning it is not defective.
end===================================================












 : start===================================================
This code contains a code smell of type UO1. The variable "es_plugins_reinstall" is unnecessarily set with `set_fact`. This override may lead to unexpected behavior if not taken into account in the existing definitions.

Additionally, there is a code smell of type UO2. The variable "list_command" is being defined, but it seems to be unused, making it an unnecessary definition.

Therefore, the code is defective due to the mentioned code smells.

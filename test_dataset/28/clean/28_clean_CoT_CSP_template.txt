The following is six categories of code smells in Ansible script. You can safely assume that the script is defective if it contains a code smell.
1. UR1: Due to an impure initialiser, the variable value may have changed.
2. UR2: The upstream variable has been redefined, so the variable value may have changed.
3. UO1: A new definition overrides a previous definition at a higher precedence without taking the previous definition into account.
4. UO2: A variable definition is manifested while a previous definition already exists, so the definition is unused.
5. HP1: "set_fact" is unnecessarily used when both the expression and all task conditions already took higher precedence.
6. HP2: "include_vars" is unnecessarily used when it will be executed unconditionally.

The followings are example of Ansible scripts.
Q1:

- name: set_fact arwp_plugin_is_installed as false
  set_fact:
    arwp_plugin_is_installed: false

- name: check if plugin {{ item.slug }} is installed
  become: yes
  become_user: "{{ arwp_user_name }}"
  command: wp plugin is-installed {{ item.slug }}
  args:
    chdir: "{{ arwp_fact_wordpress_path }}"
  ignore_errors: yes
  changed_when: false
  register: is_installed

- name: set_fact arwp_plugin_is_installed as true
  set_fact:
    arwp_plugin_is_installed: true
  when: is_installed.rc == 0
A1: This code contains a code smell of type UO1, because Potential unintended unconditional override of variable "arwp_plugin_is_installed@1".. Therefore, the code is defective.
Q2:

- name: set_fact arwp_fact_plugin_is_installed as false
  set_fact:
    arwp_fact_plugin_is_installed: false

- name: check if plugin {{ item.slug }} is installed
  become: yes
  become_user: "{{ arwp_user_name }}"
  command: wp plugin is-installed {{ item.slug }}
  args:
    chdir: "{{ arwp_fact_wordpress_path }}"
  ignore_errors: yes
  changed_when: false
  register: arwp_result_plugin_is_installed

- name: set_fact arwp_fact_plugin_is_installed as true
  set_fact:
    arwp_fact_plugin_is_installed: true
  when: arwp_result_plugin_is_installed.rc == 0
A2: This code does not contain a code smell, because it is a fixed version of the above example. Therefore, the code is not defective.
